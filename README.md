## What is Allstar?

[Allstar](https://github.com/ossf/allstar) is a GitHub App installed on organizations or repositories to set and enforce security policies. Its goal is to be able to continuously monitor and detect any GitHub setting or repository file contents that may be risky or do not follow security best practices. If Allstar finds a repository to be out of compliance, it will take an action such as create an issue or restore security settings.
